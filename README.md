## Greeting!
:raccoon: Hello, I'm Gil! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### About me
I'm a highly skilled Platform engineer (as there's no such thing as a DevOps engineer) with a strong background in DevOps methodologies (as this is what really counts). I have 19 years of experience working in the software industry, and I pride myself on my problem-solving abilities and innovative solutions.

### Why I do what I do
I'm motivated by making the world a better place for my children through the work of the companies I work for. My passion for improving processes drives me to continually learn and grow, so I can make a significant impact in empowering development teams to be free to work their magic.

### Current interests
![Learning](img/learn.png)   

I'm currently focused on custom command line tools that make a platform's engineer life easier. Working with charm.sh's line of tooling makes me create interesting TUI utilities and want to learn Go. Other than that, personal finance data wrangling using JupyterLab.

I'm also developing an IPython course as it seems like this is an often overlooked tool which comes in very handy.

I'm excited to collaborate on projects that align with my skills and values.
