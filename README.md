## Greeting!
:raccoon: Hello, I'm Gil! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### About me
I'm a highly skilled Platform engineer (as there's no such thing as a DevOps engineer) with a strong background in DevOps methodologies (as this is what really counts). I have 19 years of experience working in the software industry, and I pride myself on my problem-solving abilities and innovative solutions.

### Why I do what I do
I'm motivated by making the world a better place for my children through the work of the companies I work for. My passion for improving processes drives me to continually learn and grow, so I can make a significant impact in empowering development teams to be free to work their magic.

### Current interests
